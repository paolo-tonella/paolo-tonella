<b>ROBULA: </b>
Automated creation of robust locators for web testing. This tool generates
xpath locators that target web page elements used in test case actions or
assertions. The generated locators are optmized to be resilient to the evolution of the 
web application under test.

<li class="list-group-item">
<b>EvoSuite-MOSA: </b>
Automated test case generation for unit testing of Java classes. MOSA extends EvoSuite 
with a novel many objective algorithm, which achieves high coverage very efficiently.
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICST.2015.7102604"> DOI </a>

<li class="list-group-item">
<b>ReAjax: </b>
Reverse engineering and testing of Ajax web applications. This tool extracts a finite 
state model of the Ajax web application under test by dynamic anaysis, and uses the model
for test case derivation.

<li class="list-group-item">
<b>eToc: </b>
Tool for evolutionary generation of object-oriented test cases. Presented at ISSTA 2004,
this tool initiated a new stream of research on automated unit testing that produced,
among others, EvoSuite, a mature and advanced Java test case generator.

<li class="list-group-item">
<b>RuleChecker: </b>
Automated verification of the code compliance to coding conventions and detection of programming
anti-patterns. The tool has been routinely used at CERN, Geneva, to check the quality
of the C++ software for data analysis and physics simulation.

<b>ReWeb</b> and <b>TestWeb: </b>
Based on the algorithms described in the ICSE MIP award winning paper "Analysis and
Testing of Web Applications", these two tools support the creation of a web application
model and the derivation of test cases from such model.
